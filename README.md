# django_Cloud_kitechn_project
The goal of this project is to build an web application using Django for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users will be able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

On this web app, users can :

Register, login, browse the menu and items to their cart.
If appropriate, they can add topping and extras.
Once an order is complete, user can decide to place an order.
After submission, the items will be remove from the current cart and the site administrator can:

See a new order on the admin interface that he/she can mark as completed.
Add or update category and name of product if needed.
